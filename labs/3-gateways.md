# Lab: Creating a deployment and using a Gateway to expose it

In this lab, we will deploy a Hello World application to the cluster. We will then deploy a Gateway resource and a VirtualService that binds to the Gateway to expose the application on the external IP address.

Let's start by deploying the Gateway resource first. We will set the `hosts` field to `*`, so we can access the ingress gateway directly from the external IP address. If we wanted to access the ingress gateway through a domain name, we could set the hosts' value to a domain name (e.g. `example.com`) and then add the external IP address to an A record for the domain.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - 'hello.com'
```

Save the above YAML to `gateway.yaml` and deploy the Gateway using `kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml`

If we try to access the ingress gateways' external IP address, we will get back an HTTP 404, because there aren't any VirtualServices bound to the Gateway.

Let's look at the Envoy config and see the config that gets created. First, we need to get the ingress gateway Pod name:

```sh
$ kubectl get po -l app=istio-ingressgateway -A
NAMESPACE      NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-system   istio-ingressgateway-777d97778b-8j8mj   1/1     Running   0          30m
```
We can now use the Pod name (in this case `istio-ingressgateway-777d97778b-8j8mj`) in the proxy config routes command. Don't forget to add the `.istio-system` to the full Pod name:

```
$ istioctl pc routes istio-ingressgateway-777d97778b-8j8mj.istio-system

NAME        DOMAINS     MATCH                  VIRTUAL SERVICE
http.80     *           /*                     404
            *           /healthz/ready*
            *           /stats/prometheus*
```
Note that regardless what the hosts are set to in the gateway, because we don't have any virtual services attached it will show a 404.

To get the ingress gateways external IP address, run the command below and look at the `EXTERNAL-IP` column value:

```bash
$ kubectl get svc -l=istio=ingressgateway -n istio-system
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                                                                      AGE
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.0.98.7    50.130.100.200   15021:31395/TCP,80:32542/TCP,443:31347/TCP,31400:32663/TCP,15443:31525/TCP   9h
```

Throughout the rest of the course, we'll be using `GATEWAY_URL` in examples and text when we talk about the ingress gateway's external IP.

You can set the `GATEWAY_URL` variable like this:

```sh
export GATEWAY_URL=$(kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

The next step is to create the Hello World deployment and service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  labels:
    app: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: gcr.io/tetratelabs/hello-world:1.0.0
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: svc
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  labels:
    app: hello-world
spec:
  selector:
    app: hello-world
  ports:
    - port: 80
      name: http
      targetPort: 3000
```

Save the above YAML to `hello-world.yaml` and create the deployment and service using `kubectl apply -f hello-world.yaml`. If we look at the created Pods, we will notice two containers running. One is the Envoy sidecar proxy, and the second one is the application. We have also created a Kubernetes service called `hello-world`:

```bash
$ kubectl get po,svc -l=app=hello-world
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/hello-world-6bf9d9bdb6-r8bb4   2/2     Running   0          78s

NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/hello-world   ClusterIP   10.0.155.147   <none>        80/TCP    78s
```

The next step is to create a VirtualService for the `hello-world` service and bind it to the Gateway resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  hosts:
    - 'hello.com'
  gateways:
    - gateway
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: hello-world.default.svc.cluster.local
            port:
              number: 80
```

We are matching the value of the `hosts` field with the hosts defined in the Gateway resource. We have also added the Gateway resource we created earlier (`gateway`) to the `gateways` array. Finally, we are specifying a single route with a destination that points to the Kubernetes service `hello-world.default.svc.cluster.local`.

Save the above YAML to `vs-hello-world.yaml` and create the VirtualService using `kubectl apply -f vs-hello-world.yaml`. If you look at the deployed VirtualService, you should see a similar output:

```bash
$ kubectl get vs
NAME          GATEWAYS    HOSTS   AGE
hello-world   [gateway]   ["hello.com"]     3m31s
```

Let's check the Envoy routes again:

```
$ istioctl pc routes [ingress-gateway-pod]
NAME        DOMAINS       MATCH                  VIRTUAL SERVICE
http.80     hello.com     /*                     hello-world.default
            *             /healthz/ready*
            *             /stats/prometheus*
```

This time you'll notice the domain is set to `hello.com` and a virtual service (`hello-world.default`) mapped to that domain shows up as well.

If we run cURL against `GATEWAY_URL` or open it in the browser, we will get back a response of `Hello World`:

```bash
$ curl -v -H "Host: hello.com" http://$GATEWAY_URL/
*   Trying GATEWAY_URL...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to GATEWAY_URL (GATEWAY_URL) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: GATEWAY_URL
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< date: Mon, 28 Sep 2020 02:59:37 GMT
< content-length: 11

< x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
< server: istio-envoy
<
* Connection #0 to host GATEWAY_URL left intact
Hello World* Closing connection 0
```

Also, notice the `server` header set to `istio-envoy` telling us that the request went through the Envoy proxy.

## Cleanup

Delete the Deployment, Service, VirtualService, and the Gateway:

```bash
kubectl delete deploy hello-world
kubectl delete service hello-world
kubectl delete vs hello-world
kubectl delete gateway gateway
```
